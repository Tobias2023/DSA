'''
Overview:
  - I think of it as more a technique than an algorithm. It's a technique that could be utilized in various algorithms.

I think the technique is best understood with the following example. Imagine we have this array:

Problem:
[ 5, 7, 1, 4, 3, 6, 2, 9, 2 ]
How would we find the largest sum of five consecutive elements?   

Steps: 
  - Create a variable to track the largest sum 
  - Use two pointers:
    - First pointer; at zero index (step forward each iteration)
    - Minus that first index s
